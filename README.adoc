Microservices Shared Session using Hazelcast

API-GTW logs user in and generates a per-user session identifier propagated to every service.

Every service that uses a session retrieves it by using the generated identifier.

Services should be able to store and retrieve custom objects without sharing dependencies (classes) with other microservices.
 -> the session object might be lazily deserialized.

The session should expire at the same time for all services.

Any access to the session by a microservice should extend the session duration.

Issue:

 - Deserialization exception upon insertion of an object of a class that is not shared

Reproduce:

 - Start api-gtw (from api-gtw folder): mvn spring-boot:run

 - Start service-1 (from service-1 folder): mvn spring-boot:run

 - navigate http://localhost:8080/login and login using the following credentials: user:password

 - this api always return the current session id http://localhost:8080/ and increases a counter in session

 - this api returns the session's current counter value: http://localhost:8080/counter

 - requests under /service-1 are forwarded to service-1

 - when logged in a request to http://localhost:8080/service-1/counter returns the current session's counter

 - when logged in a request to http://localhost:8080/service-1 returns the session id and puts a CustomObject into the session

 - At this point a deserialization exception is thrown on the api-gtw
